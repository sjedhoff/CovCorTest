Description: A compilation of tests for hypotheses regarding covariance and correlation matrices for one or more groups. 
 The hypothesis can be specified through a corresponding hypothesis matrix and a vector or by choosing one of the basic hypotheses, while for 
 the structure test, only the latter works. Thereby Monte-Carlo and Bootstrap-techniques are used, and the respective method must be chosen, 
 and the functions provide p-values and mostly also estimators of calculated covariance matrices of test statistics.
