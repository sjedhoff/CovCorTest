	abstract = {Covariance matrices of random vectors contain information that is crucial for modelling. Certain structures and patterns of the covariances (or correlations) may be used to justify parametric models, e.g., autoregressive models. Until now, there have been only few approaches for testing such covariance structures systematically and in a uniﬁed way. In the present paper, we propose such a uniﬁed testing procedure, and we will exemplify the approach with a large variety of covariance structure models. This includes common structures such as diagonal matrices, Toeplitz matrices, and compound symmetry but also the more involved autoregressive matrices. We propose hypothesis tests for these structures, and we use bootstrap techniques for better small-sample approximation. The structures of the proposed tests invite for adaptations to other covariance patterns by choosing the hypothesis matrix appropriately. We prove their correctness for large sample sizes. The proposed methods require only weak assumptions. With the help of a simulation study, we assess the small sample properties of the tests. We also analyze a real data set to illustrate the application of the procedure.},

	abstract = {We introduce a uniﬁed approach to testing a variety of rather general null hypotheses that can be formulated in terms of covariances matrices. These include as special cases, for example, testing for equal variances, equal traces, or for elements of the covariance matrix taking certain values. The proposed method only requires very few assumptions and thus promises to be of broad practical use. Two test statistics are deﬁned, and their asymptotic or approximate sampling distributions are derived. In order to particularly improve the small-sample behavior of the resulting tests, two bootstrapbased methods are developed and theoretically justiﬁed. Several simulations shed light on the performance of the proposed tests. The analysis of a real data set illustrates the application of the procedures.},

	abstract = {Correlation matrices are an essential tool for investigating the dependency structures of random vectors or comparing them. We introduce an approach for testing a variety of null hypotheses that can be formulated based upon the correlation matrix. Examples cover MANOVA-type hypothesis of equal correlation matrices as well as testing for special correlation structures such as sphericity. Apart from existing fourth moments, our approach requires no other assumptions, allowing applications in various settings. To improve the small sample performance, a bootstrap technique is proposed and theoretically justified. Based on this, we also present a procedure to simultaneously test the hypotheses of equal correlation and equal covariance matrices. The performance of all new test statistics is compared with existing procedures through extensive simulations.},
