\title{Test for structure of data's covariance matrix}
\usage{
test_covariance_structure(
  X,
  structure,
  method = "BT",
  repetitions = 1000,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix containing the observation vectors as columns
(one group only)}

\item{structure}{a character specifying the structure regarding the
covariance matrix should be checked. Options are "autoregressive" ("ar"),
"FO-autoregressive" ("FO-ar"), "diagonal" ("diag"), "sphericity" ("spher"),
"compoundsymmetry" ("cs") and "toeplitz" ("toep").}

\item{method}{a character, to chose whether bootstrap("BT") or
Monte-Carlo-technique("MC") is used, while bootstrap is the
predefined method.}

\item{repetitions}{a scalar, indicate the number of runs for the chosen
method.
The predefined value is 1,000, and the number should not be below 500.}

\item{seed}{a seed, if it should be set for reproducibility. Predefined value
is NULL, which means no seed is set.}
}
\value{
an object of the class \code{\link{CovTest}}
}
\description{
This function conducts the test for the covariance matrix of
data regarding structures. Depending on the chosen method a bootstrap or
Monte-Carlo-technique is used to calculate p-value of the
Anova-type-statistic(ATS) based on a specified number of runs.

\examples{
# Load the data
data("EEGwide", package = "MANOVA.RM")

# Select only the males with the diagnosis AD
X <- as.matrix(EEGwide[EEGwide$sex == "W" & EEGwide$diagnosis == "AD",
                          c("brainrate_temporal", "brainrate_frontal",
                          "brainrate_central","complexity_temporal",
                          "complexity_frontal", "complexity_central")])
