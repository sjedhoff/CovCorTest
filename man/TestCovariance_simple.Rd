\title{Simplified call for test regarding covariance matrices}
\usage{
TestCovariance_simple(
  X,
  nv = NULL,
  hypothesis,
  A = NULL,
  method = "MC",
  repetitions = 1000,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a list or matrix containing the observation vectors. In case of a list,
each matrix in this list is another group, where the observation vectors are the
columns. For a matrix, all groups are together in one matrix and nv is used to indicate
the group sizes. For one group, nv is not necessary}

\item{nv}{vector of sample sizes for the bootstrap samples per group}

\item{hypothesis}{a character to choose one of the predefined hypotheses which are
"equal", "equal-trace", "equal-diagonals", "given-trace", "given-matrix" and "uncorrelated"}

\item{A}{a scalar or square matrix to specify the hypothesis in case of
"given-trace" or "given-matrix". The value is predefined as NULL, which means
trace of 1 resp the identity as given matrix.}

\item{method}{a character, to chose whether bootstrap("BT") or
Monte-Carlo-technique("MC") is used, while bootstrap is the predefined method.}

\item{repetitions}{a scalar,  indicate the number of runs for the chosen method.
The predefined value is 1,000, and the number should not be below 500.}

\item{seed}{A seed, if it should be set for reproducibility. Predefined values
is NULL, which means no seed is set. A chosen seed is deleted at the end.}
}
\value{
an object of the class 'CovTest'
}
\description{
This function is for more applied users so no hypothesis matrix or
corresponding vector is necessary. This is replaced by predefined hypotheses,
from which is chosen. From this C and Xi are built and the function
\code{\link{TestCovariance_base}} is used.

# Load the data
data("EEGwide", package = "MANOVA.RM")

vars <- colnames(EEGwide)[1:6]

# Part the data into six groups of sex and diagnosis
